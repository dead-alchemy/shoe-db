# David Nicholas Express / React Starter

This is a quick start pack to help me get started with react / express projects.

This project uses yarn over npm.

## Scripts

Here is a run down of the scripts and what they are doing.

| Script Name    | Description                                        |
| :------------- | :------------------------------------------------- |
| build          | Builds our React App                               |
| dev-api        | Starts our api using Nodemon to provide hot reload |
| dev-client     | Starts our React App                               |
| dev            | Runs both dev-api and dev-client concurrently.     |
| start-api      | Starts our api.                                    |

| start          | Runs both start-api and start-client concurrently. |
| install-api    | installs the packages for the api.                 |
| install-client | installs the packages for the React app.           |
| postinstall    | runs both install-api install-client               |

## Api

Use Postgress over all else.

Connectors is where our connection detials go.

Model is where our queries go.

Routes. Make sure to add new routes to index.js

## Client

REACT.

I added Chakra by default but feel free to use whatever.
